# GitHub Flavored Markdown Demo

This post demonstrates the GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) features that are now available on this site.

## Tables

Here's a sample table with different data types:

| Feature | Status | Priority | Notes |
|---------|--------|----------|-------|
| Tables | ‚úÖ Complete | High | Works perfectly |
| Strikethrough | ‚úÖ Complete | Medium | ~~Old text~~ |
| Task Lists | ‚úÖ Complete | High | See below |
| Autolinks | ‚úÖ Complete | Low | https://github.com |

## Strikethrough Text

You can now use strikethrough text: ~~This text is crossed out~~ and this text is normal.

## Task Lists

Here are some example tasks:

- [x] Install remark-gfm plugin
- [x] Configure Next.js with GFM support
- [x] Create demo post
- [ ] Test all GFM features
- [ ] Update documentation

## Autolinks

GFM automatically converts URLs to links:
- https://github.com
- http://example.com
- user@example.com

## Code Blocks with Language

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('World'));
```

## Inline Code

You can use `inline code` with backticks.

## Tables with Alignment

You can align table columns:

| Left Aligned | Center Aligned | Right Aligned |
|:-------------|:--------------:|--------------:|
| Left         | Center         | Right         |
| Text         | Text           | Text          |

## Strikethrough in Tables

| Task | Status |
|------|--------|
| ~~Old task~~ | ‚ùå Cancelled |
| New task | ‚úÖ Complete |

## Mixed Content

Here's a combination of GFM features:

- [x] ~~Old completed task~~
- [ ] Current task in progress
- [ ] Future task

| Priority | Task | Status |
|:--------:|------|--------|
| High | ~~Fix critical bug~~ | ‚úÖ Done |
| Medium | Add new feature | üîÑ In Progress |
| Low | Update docs | ‚è≥ Pending |

## Conclusion

GitHub Flavored Markdown support is now fully integrated into this site! You can use all the GFM features including tables, strikethrough, task lists, and autolinks in your MDX posts.
