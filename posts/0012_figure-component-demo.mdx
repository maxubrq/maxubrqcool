# Figure Component Demo

Welcome to the Figure component showcase! This post demonstrates the new Figure component that provides automatic Cloudinary URL handling, lightbox functionality, and enhanced image display capabilities.

## Basic Usage

The Figure component automatically transforms paths starting with `/maxubrqcool` to Cloudinary URLs:

<Figure 
  src="/maxubrqcool/Bhargava-Algorithms_hires_wccjn8.png"
  alt="Bhargava Algorithms Book Cover"
  title="Bhargava Algorithms"
  caption="A comprehensive guide to algorithms and data structures"
/>

## With Custom Title and Caption

You can add titles and captions to provide context:

<Figure 
  src="/maxubrqcool/Bhargava-Algorithms_hires_wccjn8.png"
  alt="Algorithm Book"
  title="Mastering Algorithms"
  caption="This book covers essential algorithms every developer should know"
/>

## Regular Images (Non-Cloudinary)

For images that don't start with `/maxubrqcool`, the component treats them as regular URLs:

<Figure 
  src="https://via.placeholder.com/400x300/4f46e5/ffffff?text=Regular+Image"
  alt="Placeholder Image"
  title="Regular Image Example"
  caption="This image uses a regular URL and won't be transformed to Cloudinary"
/>

## Simple Figure (No Lightbox)

For cases where you don't need lightbox functionality, use the SimpleFigure component:

<SimpleFigure 
  src="/maxubrqcool/Bhargava-Algorithms_hires_wccjn8.png"
  alt="Simple Figure Example"
  title="Simple Figure"
  caption="This figure doesn't have lightbox functionality"
/>

## Multiple Figures

You can use multiple figures in your content:

<Figure 
  src="/maxubrqcool/Bhargava-Algorithms_hires_wccjn8.png"
  alt="First Algorithm Book"
  title="Algorithms Book 1"
  caption="Essential algorithms for beginners"
/>

<Figure 
  src="/maxubrqcool/Bhargava-Algorithms_hires_wccjn8.png"
  alt="Second Algorithm Book"
  title="Algorithms Book 2"
  caption="Advanced algorithms for experienced developers"
/>

## Features

The Figure component includes:

- **Automatic Cloudinary Integration**: Paths starting with `/maxubrqcool` are automatically transformed to Cloudinary URLs
- **Lightbox Functionality**: Click any image to open it in a full-screen lightbox
- **Title and Caption Support**: Add descriptive titles and captions
- **Download and External Link**: In lightbox mode, you can download images or open them in new tabs
- **Responsive Design**: Images adapt to different screen sizes
- **Loading States**: Smooth loading animations
- **Hover Effects**: Interactive hover states with zoom indicators

## Cloudinary URL Transformation

The component automatically transforms URLs like:
- `/maxubrqcool/image.png` â†’ `https://res.cloudinary.com/dmsb4anlx/image/upload/v1761479207/maxubrqcool/image.png`

This ensures optimal image delivery through Cloudinary's CDN while maintaining a simple path structure in your content.

## Usage in MDX

To use the Figure component in your MDX files, simply import it and use it like any other React component:

```jsx
<Figure 
  src="/maxubrqcool/Bhargava-Algorithms_hires_wccjn8.png"
  alt="Description of the image"
  title="Optional Title"
  caption="Optional Caption"
/>
```

## Conclusion

The Figure component provides a powerful and flexible way to display images in your MDX content with automatic Cloudinary integration, lightbox functionality, and enhanced user experience. Try clicking on any of the images above to see the lightbox in action!
