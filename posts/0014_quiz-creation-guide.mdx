# Quiz Creation Guide

There are several ways to create quizzes in your MDX content. Let me show you the different approaches:

## Approach 1: Dedicated Quiz Components (Recommended)

For each quiz, create a dedicated component. This gives you full control and is the most flexible.

### Example: React Quiz

<ReactQuiz />

## Approach 2: Reusable Quiz Component

Use the `ReusableQuiz` component with inline question data:

<ReusableQuiz
  title="TypeScript Fundamentals Quiz"
  description="Test your knowledge of TypeScript basics"
  timeLimit={8}
  passingScore={80}
  questions={[
    {
      id: "ts-1",
      question: "What is the main benefit of using TypeScript?",
      type: "single-choice",
      options: [
        "Faster runtime performance",
        "Static type checking",
        "Smaller bundle size",
        "Better SEO"
      ],
      correctAnswer: "Static type checking",
      explanation: "TypeScript's main benefit is static type checking at compile time.",
      points: 10,
      difficulty: "easy",
      tags: ["types", "benefits"]
    },
    {
      id: "ts-2",
      question: "Which of the following are valid TypeScript features?",
      type: "multiple-choice",
      options: [
        "Interfaces",
        "Generics",
        "Union Types",
        "Decorators",
        "var declarations",
        "class inheritance"
      ],
      correctAnswer: ["Interfaces", "Generics", "Union Types", "Decorators", "class inheritance"],
      explanation: "All of these are valid TypeScript features. var declarations are JavaScript, not TypeScript-specific.",
      points: 15,
      difficulty: "medium",
      tags: ["features", "syntax"]
    },
    {
      id: "ts-3",
      question: "Write a TypeScript interface for a User object with id (number), name (string), and email (string).",
      type: "code",
      correctAnswer: "interface User { id: number; name: string; email: string; }",
      explanation: "A basic TypeScript interface definition.",
      points: 20,
      difficulty: "medium",
      tags: ["interfaces", "types"]
    }
  ]}
/>

## Approach 3: QuizBuilder (Advanced)

For complex quizzes with MDX content in questions, use the QuizBuilder:

The QuizBuilder allows you to include rich MDX content within quiz questions, such as:

- Code examples with syntax highlighting
- Images and diagrams
- Mathematical expressions
- Interactive components
- Custom styling and formatting

This is perfect for technical quizzes where you need to show code snippets, explain concepts with visual aids, or provide detailed context within the question itself.

## Best Practices

### 1. **Choose the Right Approach**
- **Dedicated Components**: For unique, complex quizzes
- **ReusableQuiz**: For simple quizzes with standard questions
- **QuizBuilder**: For quizzes with rich MDX content in questions

### 2. **Question Design**
- Use clear, concise questions
- Provide good explanations
- Set appropriate difficulty levels
- Include relevant tags for organization

### 3. **Quiz Configuration**
- Set reasonable time limits
- Choose appropriate passing scores
- Consider question order and flow
- Test your quiz before publishing

### 4. **Encryption Benefits**
All approaches use client-side encryption:
- Answers are obfuscated in source code
- Prevents casual inspection
- Maintains quiz integrity

## Creating Your Own Quiz

To create a new quiz, follow these steps:

1. **Create a new component** (e.g., `MyQuiz.tsx`)
2. **Define your questions** with proper structure
3. **Add encryption** using `encryptAnswerAdvanced`
4. **Import in mdx-components.tsx**
5. **Use in your MDX files**

### Example Structure:

```typescript
const myQuestions = [
  {
    id: "q1",
    question: "Your question here?",
    type: "single-choice",
    options: ["Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3"],
    correctAnswer: "Option 1",
    explanation: "Why this is correct",
    points: 10,
    difficulty: "easy",
    tags: ["topic1", "topic2"]
  }
]

const encryptedQuestions = myQuestions.map(q => ({
  ...q,
  correctAnswer: encryptAnswerAdvanced(q.correctAnswer, q.id)
}))
```

## Conclusion

Choose the approach that best fits your needs:
- **Simple quizzes**: Use `ReusableQuiz`
- **Complex quizzes**: Create dedicated components
- **Rich content**: Use `QuizBuilder`

All approaches provide the same great UX with animations, encryption, and responsive design!
