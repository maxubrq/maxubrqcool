# Book-Style Article Layout — Reading as Craft

> Typography is information architecture made visible. This article explores a calm, book-like reading experience in the browser.

## Why a book-like layout?

On the web, we often optimize for scanning. For long-form thinking, we favor rhythm: line length ~65–80 characters, generous leading, and quiet margins. The new article layout embraces that, removing lateral UI noise so the narrative carries.

## Design notes

- Single column with ample measure for text
- Quiet micro-accents: small caps meta, subtle rules, restrained motion
- Consistent hierarchy across headings and pull-quotes

## A short story in code

```ts
export function composeLayout({ grid, rhythm }: { grid: number; rhythm: number }) {
  const baseline = rhythm * grid
  return {
    column: Math.round(72 / grid) * grid,
    baseline,
  }
}
```

## Reading flow

1. Title sets tone, not volume.
2. Intro frames questions.
3. Sections advance one idea at a time.
4. Finish with references or next steps.
